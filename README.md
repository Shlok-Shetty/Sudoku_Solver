Sudoku Solver
This Java program solves a given Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. The puzzle is represented as a 9x9 grid, where empty cells are denoted by 0. The program fills the grid such that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once.

How It Works
The program uses recursion to try every possible number in each empty cell. If a number can be placed in a cell without violating Sudoku rules, the program proceeds to the next cell. If a conflict arises, the program backtracks and tries a different number.

Main Method
The main method initializes the Sudoku grid and starts the solving process. If a solution is found, the solved grid is printed; otherwise, a message indicating no solution exists is displayed.

sudsolver Method
The sudsolver method attempts to fill the Sudoku grid using recursion and backtracking. It takes the current state of the grid, the current row, and the current column as parameters.

If the method reaches row 9, it means the entire grid is filled correctly, and the method returns true.
The method calculates the next cell to move to. If the current cell is not empty, it moves to the next cell.
For empty cells, it tries all numbers from 1 to 9. If a number can be placed without conflicts, it places the number and recursively attempts to solve the rest of the grid.
If placing a number leads to a conflict later, the method resets the cell to 0 (backtracks) and tries the next number.
If no number can be placed in the current cell, the method returns false.

isSafe Method
The isSafe method checks if placing a particular number in a specific cell is valid according to Sudoku rules. It checks the row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid to ensure no duplicate numbers.

Row-wise Check: Ensures the number is not already present in the current row.
Column-wise Check: Ensures the number is not already present in the current column.
Grid-wise Check: Ensures the number is not already present in the current 3x3 sub-grid.
